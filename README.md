## **Summary**

The consistant warm temperatures between the two months shows that a year-round ice cream and surf shop is a good idea. This is further backed up by the precipiation numbers.  While the mean precipition in June (.136 inches) is siginificantly less than December (.217 inches), it doesn't appear that this is due to more days of rain.  Look at the 75% of precipiation, the variance is much smaller, with June having .12 inches and December coming in at .15 inches.  The reason for the large mean variance appears to be due to the max precipitation statistic.  It appears that is rains just as much in June as December, however, there appears to be one or two days with significantly more rain than what occur in June.
